    <h1>Supernatural</h1>
    
    <p>The thrilling and terrifying journey of the Winchester Brothers continues with the ninth season of <em>Supernatural</em> on <em>The CW</em>.</p>
    
    <p>Sam (Jared Padalecki) and Dean (Jensen Ackles) have spent the last eight years battling the things that go bump in the night. Over the years, with the help of the fallen angel Castiel (Misha Collins), and the King of Hell, Crowley (Mark A. Sheppard), the Winchesters have straddled the line between good and evil.</p>
    
    <p>Last season, the boys faced their most important mission yet: close the gates of Hell once and for all. With the help of the prophet Kevin Tran (Osric Chau), Sam and Dean set forth to perform the Trials required to close the gates. While the boys worked to shut Crowley and his minions down for good, a new threat to his reign emerged: the Knight of Hell, Abaddon (Alaina Huffman). As the struggle for Hell’s command began, Castiel set about his own set of Trials. With the aid of God’s scribe Metatron (Curtis Armstrong), Cass went on a mission to close the Gates of Heaven. However, he found out too late that the Scribe had nefarious intentions, and Cass paid the price. His Grace forcibly removed, Castiel watched as Metatron’s machinations came to fruition – and the angels of Heaven fell.</p>
        
    <p>Season Nine begins with the fallout from the angels’ descent to Earth. Sam and Dean are faced with a world inhabited by thousands of powerful beings who immediately begin to form their own agendas. Before they can tackle the threat of the <strong>loose nukes</strong> roaming the countryside, Sam and Dean must face their most personal battle yet. Meanwhile, Castiel awakes to find himself more vulnerable than he’s ever been. As the threat of the angels escalates, the boys are tasked with finding a way to reopen the gates of Heaven and send the Host packing. But a dark secret hangs over Dean’s head – has he finally crossed the line to protect his family?</p>

     <p>From Warner Bros. Television in association with Wonderland Sound and Vision, with executive producers McG (<em>Charlie’s Angels</em>, <em>The O.C.</em>), Robert Singer (<em>Midnight Caller</em>), Jeremy Carver (<em>Being Human</em>), Phil Sgriccia and Adam Glass.</p>
